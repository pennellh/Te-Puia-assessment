      <h1>Te Puia- National Carving School</h1>
      <p>National Carving School – Te Wānanga Whakairo
        In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task 
        of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those 
        students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of 
        the institute today.
        “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, 
        Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the art 
        to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose our iden
        tity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role to save Māo
        ri art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This was my reason.
         And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later. If we lose our arts 
         and crafts we lose our identity.”
        Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the national 
        carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive Fugill and 
        James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once institute carving
         students themselves. The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war 
         dance), is intended as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength
         , however in many carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature in 
         which information was passed on from generation to generation.
        Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional Māori 
        carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National Carving 
        School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. 
        We also accept carving commissions.

      <h1>Te Puia- National Weaving School (Te Rito)</h1>
      <p>Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most 
        ancient plant species. 
        When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly discovered 
        that flax could be woven to make clothing, housing materials and 
        decorative tūrapa (panels) for their houses.
        Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. Harakeke 
        (common flax) grows up to three meters high and has firm, long leaves 
        with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types of weaving. Wharariki 
        (mountain flax) is found along coast lines, growing up to 1.6 meters 
        with softer leaves and less fibre than harakeke.
        At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and 
        traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. “I believe weaving can 
        only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by listening, by touching and 
        by doing,” says head of the weaving school, Edna Pahewa.
        As well as learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other materials, 
        students learn the stories and designs unique to each iwi (tribe), as 
        well as the Māori protocols associated with weaving. These include 
        planting according to the phases of the moon and reciting prayers of 
        thanks for flax and trees used.
        Te Rito is named after the baby shoot that sits deep at the heart of 
        the flax. That baby is protected by two outside shoots, the mother and 
        father. Students learn never to touch the inner three shoots when 
        cutting the flax as they are the nucleus - the family unit too precious 
        to be broken. Without these shoots, the flax will lose its identity.
        Māori used various art forms to record their histories and stories, 
        preserving them for future generations. Weaving patterns and styles were
         designed to symbolise particular stories and these were handed 
         down within a family or tribe.</p>
