      <p>National Carving School – Te Wānanga Whakairo
        In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task 
        of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those 
        students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of 
        the institute today.
        “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, 
        Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the art 
        to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose our iden
        tity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role to save Māo
        ri art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This was my reason.
         And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later. If we lose our arts 
         and crafts we lose our identity.”
        Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the national 
        carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive Fugill and 
        James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once institute carving
         students themselves. The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war 
         dance), is intended as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength
         , however in many carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature in 
         which information was passed on from generation to generation.
        Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional Māori 
        carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National Carving 
        School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. 
        We also accept carving commissions.
